# The missionaries and cannibals problem, from exercise 3.9.
# Three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river.
# The boat can cross the river with 1 or 2 people at a time.
# If there are missionaries on a side of the river, they
# cannot be outnumbered by the cannibals or they will be eaten.
