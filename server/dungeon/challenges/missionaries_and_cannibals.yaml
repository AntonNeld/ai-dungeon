# The missionaries and cannibals problem, from exercise 3.9.
# Three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river.
# The boat can cross the river with 1 or 2 people at a time.
# If there are missionaries on a side of the river, they
# cannot be outnumbered by the cannibals or they will be eaten.

# Under construction.
# Sketch:
#    - Player is a boat that can pick up missionaries or cannibals.
#      It cannot cross the river with an empty inventory.
#    - Cannibals check how many missionaries and cannibals they can
#      reach. If there are more cannibals (including itself), they
#      go to the nearest missionary and kill it.
#    - Score for the player is calculated by tile tag scoring on the other
#      side of the river. There is also a move penalty to keep it short.
#
# Needed:
#    - Entity that can only be passed by holding something with a tag
#    - Drop item
#    - Killing
