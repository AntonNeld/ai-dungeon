# TODOs

- Unify pickup, blocksMovement and swappable into collision component (what about action pickup?)
- Watch for changed challenges, since the dev server doesn't watch those files
- Scale labels in frontend so they always fit in the box
- Fix race condition in manual input where the controlled entity may be put back with outdated data
